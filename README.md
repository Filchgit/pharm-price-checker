# Pharm-price-checker

This is a rails application written as a paid project for a fellow pharmacist. It is currently very much in development.
It relies on data being uploaded from Z pharmacy dispense system on the pharmacist side within the program, and also 
on scraped data being uploaded by myself from my WebScraper2 program written in C#, though this also happens from within the app,
as it will constantly be updated. I am using the C# version of webscraping as I want to keep the actual data scraping off Heroku, 
and be able to scrape from behind my stealth systems like Witopia.

DB still in development; likely to add a whole lot more as time goes on.

This is currently deployed via Heroku atm.

* Ruby version 2.6.6p146 (2020-03-31 revision 67876) [x86_64-linux]
